Remote repository should be used when working in a team for collaboration, and also may be created as backup up in case something bad happens to my local system.

I like to pull changes manually because I now exactly when is the best time to do it and have control of it.  No all changes have to be pulled up


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks will clone a project withing git-hub and make links between them.  Clones will happen only locally.  And branches are different versions labeled


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To compare my version with the latest published version


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
na


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I want to work in an special feature and dont want to affect the master version yer.  It is like a trial that later on I will decide if apply or not the change base on the results.
